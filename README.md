At this point in development, I have a panel with buttons for all the numbers and arithmetic operations of a standard calculator. When pressing the buttons, the numbers and sybmols are displayed in a JTextField just above the panel with the buttons. The calculator can take in multiple numbers and respects the correct order of operations.
